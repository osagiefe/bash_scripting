The below two are particularly useful if you have a very long command.

Delete everything from the cursor to the end of the line:
Ctrl + k
Delete everything from the cursor to the start of the line:
Ctrl + u
Delete one word backward from cursor:
Ctrl + w
Search your history backward. This is probably the one that I use the most. It is really handy and speeds up my work-flow a lot:
Ctrl + r
Clear the screen, I use this instead of typing the clear command:
Ctrl + l
Stops the output to the screen:
Ctrl + s
Enable the output to the screen in case that previously stopped by Ctrl + s:
Ctrl + q
Terminate the current command
Ctrl + c
Throw the current command to background:
Ctrl + z
I use those regularly every day, and it saves me a lot of time.
